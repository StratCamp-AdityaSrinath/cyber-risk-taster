# Notes:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# - Ranges reflect uncertainty in attack co-occurrence, service dependencies, and industry/size risk profiles.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# - NAICS codes are unique, aggregating duplicates (e.g., multiple NAICS 31 entries) into a single risk profile per code.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# - Employee size correlations are higher for adjacent bands (e.g., 10–14 vs. 15–19: 0.6–0.8) due to similar IT setups, lower for distant bands (e.g., <5 vs. 5,000+: 0.1–0.3) due to differing attack surfaces.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Use these matrices in an Excel-based Monte Carlo simulation or copula model to estimate pure premium by NAICS and employee size.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"# - For Excel output, store matrices in a separate worksheet and use VLOOKUP/INDEX-MATCH to apply correlations in pure premium calculations for each deductible-limit tab.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
# - Adjust ranges with specific threat intelligence or historical incident data if available.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
